# Google Drive MCP Tool Server

This project provides a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server for interacting with **Google Drive**.  
It uses [`fastmcp`](https://pypi.org/project/mcp-server-fastmcp/) as the MCP server framework and exposes tools for common Drive operations such as:

- Creating folders
- Listing directory contents
- Navigating paths
- Writing files
- Reading files

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Create folders inside Google Drive  
- âœ… List contents of any folder  
- âœ… Navigate to a path inside Google Drive 
- âœ… Read and write files  

## Python Version Dependencies

- **Working**: Python 3.11, Python 3.12
- **Not Working**: Python 3.13
    - **Reason**: pydantic-core does not have pre-built wheels for Python 3.13.
    - Installing on 3.13 requires Rust compiler to build pydantic-core from source.
    - **Recommended**: Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 for seamless installation with pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo and navigate into it:
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd gdrive-mcp
```

2. Create virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Google Drive API Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google Drive API credentials for the MCP server.

## Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Note your project ID

## Step 2: Enable Google Drive API

1. In Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
2. Search for "Google Drive API"
3. Click "Enable"

## Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

### For Development/Testing:
1. Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
3. Choose "Desktop application" 
4. Name it "MCP Google Drive Client"
5. Download the JSON file
6. Rename it to `credentials.json` and place in `gdrive-mcp/` folder
7. Add Test Users (Important for unverified apps):
   - Go to APIs & Services â†’ OAuth consent screen â†’ audience â†’ Test users â†’ Add users
   - Enter your Gmail address (e.g., `your_email@gmail.com`)
   - Only these users can authenticate during testing

### For Production/Server:
1. Choose "Web application" instead
2. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://localhost:3007/oauth/callback` (for local testing)
   - Your production callback URL
3. Download and rename to `credentials.json`

## Step 4: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in `gdrive-mcp/` folder:

```bash
# Google Drive API Configuration
GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS=credentials.json
GOOGLE_DRIVE_TOKEN=token.pickle

```

## User-to-User Authentication (FastAPI)
The server includes a FastAPI authentication layer to manage multiple users securely.

### Start FastAPI Auth Server
```bash
python auth_setup.py
```

Endpoints:
1. `GET/` â†’ Sample endpoint
2. `GET/health` â†’ Server status & user count
3. `POST/auth` â†’ Register or login a user

### Example: Create User
Send a POST request to `/auth`:
Request:
```bash
{
  "user_id": "alice",
  "password": "mypassword123"
}
```
Response:
```bash
{
  "message": "âœ… User 'alice' created, Google token saved, and logged in."
}
```
### Example: Login User
Send a POST request to `/auth`:
Request:
```bash
{
  "user_id": "alice",
  "password": "mypassword123"
}
```
Response:
```bash
{
  "message": "âœ… Logged in as alice"
}
```
âœ… Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
âœ… Google OAuth tokens are stored per user in tokens/<user_id>_token.pickle
âœ… Tokens are auto-refreshed if expired

## Run the server:

```bash
uv run gdrive_mcp_server.py
```
You will be prompted to log in:
```bash
Existing users: alice
Enter user ID: alice
Enter password: ****
âœ… Logged in as alice
```

The MCP server will start using streamable-http transport.

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| `create_folder` | Create a new folder in Google Drive | `name: str`, `parent_id: str = "root"` |
| `list_directory` | List contents of a folder | `folder_id: str = "root"`, `max_results: int = 100` |
| `navigate_path` | Navigate to a specific path in Drive | `path: str` |
| `write_file` | Write content to a file | `name: str`, `content: str`, `file_id: str`, `parent_id: str = "root"` |
| `read_file` | Read content from a file | `file_id: str`, `encoding: str = "utf-8"` |

### Testing with Postman

1. Open Postman (latest version with MCP support).
2. Click New â†’ MCP Request.
3. Enter the MCP server URL:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

4. Click Connect.
5. You will now see all available tools (create_folder, list_directory, etc.) listed in the Messages block automatically.
6. Select a tool and provide input arguments.
7. Run the request â€” you will get the live response from Google Drive.

âœ… No need to craft raw JSON manually â€” Postman MCP automatically lists and formats available tools for you.

### Notes

- Do not commit `credentials.json` or user tokens to GitHub.
- Add `credentials.json` and `tokens/` folder to `.gitignore`.
- If OAuth fails, delete the userâ€™s token file and re-run `/auth`.
